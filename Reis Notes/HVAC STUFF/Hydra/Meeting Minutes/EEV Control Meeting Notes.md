Questions that control team needs answered from product team:
	1. What do we want to control? (superheat or sub cool) need targets
	2. What sensors will we use?
	3. Need desired control outputs not sequence of operation based on previous sequences

- Can use DDC as a prototype to get quicker and faster testing due to delays with hardware implementation on the Hydra PCB
- Devin and Kyle will be the product team heads

Goal:
- We want one nice PID controller
- We don't want one big bang-bang control with 16 if/else conditions

Fun Facts (opinionated):
- Residential like TXVs that can adjust to help meet ASHRAE standards
- LC have more skilled techs (opinion) due to more complex equipment
