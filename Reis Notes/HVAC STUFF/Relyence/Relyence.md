**Fault Tree Analysis Tool:**
	- You can save certain branches or events to use on several projects
	- There are several gate options:
		- Green - collapses certain section of the branch that extends
		- OR/AND - most commonly used and are the same basic logical operators
	- Events:
		- Default failure rate is failures per million hours(can be changed in settings)
		- Event Types:
			- Basic - your basic type
			- Repeat - shows that the same event can occur after certain things occur
			- Underdeveloped - to offer insight that this needs to be developed more down the road
		- You can link FMEA events into the the fault tree
	- Use transfer gates (green ones) to help organize a massive tree and break it up into sections instead of having one massive tree
	- A cut set in FMEA/FTA is a group of failure events that, if they all happen, will cause the top-level system failure. A minimal cut set is the leanest such group.
	- Calculate Fault Tree:
		- you can gather both qualitative and quantitative results
